# Usage

Monopoly is available as a [web application](https://monopoly.streamlit.app), and an offline desktop application that can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/benjamin-awd/monopoly-streamlit/releases) page.

The offline application runs Streamlit locally, and uses a [WebView](https://tauri.app/v1/references/webview-versions/) window to view the browser frontend at http://localhost:8501.

# Development

```shell
poetry install
poetry shell
```

To run the consumer-facing application:
```shell
python entrypoint.py
```

To run the application in developer mode:
```shell

```

# Features
- Supports uploading multiple bank statements
- Allows unlocking of PDFs using user-provided credentials via the frontend
